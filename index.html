    <h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
    <h2> A back-story</h2>
        <div class="about">
          <p>
            My name is <strong>Chelsea Owiti</strong>
            I'm actually fresh out of highschool and studied at Loreto Msongari.
            Joining Moringa, has been a personal acheivement to me because
            I initially faced so much backlash from friends and family about 
            my decision. But there's something about this school, that really stood out to 
            me and I couldn't let this opportunity pass.
            I beleive that life is about growth and development and that's why I'm here,
            to grow and to progress as an individual. Its not only about the coding but the growth.

    <h2>Some of my interests</h2>
          <p>
             Some of my interests include outdoor activities. I honestly live for 
             everything that's done outside the house such as: rope courses and GP Karting.
             I also have an artistic side to me but I express it with the use of makeup. During my free
             time I attempt beating different's people's faces and editing pictures if I wasn't at 
             Moringa I'd probably venture into esthetics.
