    <h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
    <h2> A back-story"</h2>
    <div class="about">
      <p>
        My name is <strong>Chelsea Owiti</strong>
        I'm actually fresh out of highschool and studied at Loreto Msongari.
        Joining Moringa, has been a personal acheivement to me because
        I initially faced so much backlash from friends and family about 
        my decision. But there's something about this school, that really stood out to 
        me and I couldn't let this opportunity pass.
        I beleive that life is about growth and development and that's why I'm here,
        to grow and to progress as an individual. Its not only about the coding but the growth.

     <h2>Some of my interests</h2>
       <p>
         Some of my interests include outdoor activities. I honestly live for 
         everything that's done outside the house such as: rope courses and GP Karting.
         I also have an artistic side to me but I express it with the use of makeup. During my free
         time I attempt beating different's people's faces and if I wasn't at 
         Moringa I'd probably venture into esthetics.
